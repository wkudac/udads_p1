# Stackoverlow Survey 2017 - Where are You?

## Introduction 
Stackoverflow is a public platform where developers can ask questions for and get answers to their coding issues. Annually they make a survey about topics around developing code but additionally about the work situation. The data collected in the 2017 survey contains about 51.000 responses for more than 150 questions, one of them are the countries and the gender of the participants.  The country was given by everybody, but the gender only by about 2/3 (69,2%). 

## Project Motivation 
Despite of the lower return rate of the gender, the gender feature will be part of the study. The main focus lies on the gender and the country issues whether common assumptions about the developer world could be confirmed by the survey of a developer community. 
Besides of the Stackoverflow survey data, data about the gross domestic product (gdp) from the world bank for the countries and a file from which the continent of a country is extracted are used to enrich the data set. 

1.	What is the influence of the gdp on the participation on the survey? 
2.	Is there really a gender gap in the community and how big is the gap?
3.	How is the country and continent distribution of the community members? 

For the beginning only descriptive statistics techniques are used to exploit the data. It would be interesting to know how the development of the community over the years will happen regarding the addressed topics. 


## File Descriptions 
There is one Jupyter Notebook which contains all the coding ("stov_survey.ipynb"). The data used (s.below) is copied locally in a folder called data.  
A more verbal description can be found in the following [(blog post)](https://medium.com/@wkudac/stackoverflow-survey-2017-where-are-you-f802d450fa1).
